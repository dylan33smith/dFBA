    "## Diauxisc growth in E. coli\n",
    "\n",
    "Microorganisms constantly adjust their metabolism to the nutrients available around them. One of the most classic examples of this adaptive behavior is diauxic growth, a two-phase growth pattern observed when E. coli is provided with both glucose and acetate. E. coli strongly prefers glucose because it yields energy quickly and requires minimal enzyme investment. As long as glucose is available, the cell directs most of its metabolic machinery toward consuming it. When consuming glucose rapidly, E. coli produces acetate which is secreted in a process called **overflow metabolism.** Once glucose is depleted, this acetate can be reuptaken by the cell to be oxidized. This two step growth process is called **diauxic growth.** In between these two growth phases, the cell must downregulate it's glucose metabolizing mechanisms and upregulate its acetate metabolizing mechanisms, leading to a short lag phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Respiration, Fermentation and Acetate metabolism\n",
    "In E.coli, three interconnected modes of metabolism - respiration, fermentation, and acetate metabolism - are central to the dynamics observed during this form of diauxic growth. These three modes differ strongly in ATP yield, efficiency and proteome cost, and together they account for the characteristic pattern of glucose depletion, acetate excretion and acetate reuse present in diauxic growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Respiration: high yield, oxygen dependent ATP generation** \n",
    "Under aerobic conditions, E. coli uses respiration which fully oxidizes glucose to $CO_2$ and yields ~10x more ATP per glucose than fermentation. Respiration supports rapid biomass production, has little overflow metabolites and is proteome intensive as it requires many enzyme complexes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fermentation: low yield, high rate overflow metabolism**\n",
    "When oxygen is limited or the respiratory proteome becomes saturated, E. coli switches to fermentation and secretes partially oxidized byproducts, predominantly acetate. This mode bypasses the TCA cycle resulting in low ATP yield but higher rates. This means ATP can be produced quickly but inefficiently and at the cost of acetate overflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Acetate Metabolism**\n",
    "Once glucose has been depleted and acetate is the only available carbon source, E. coli can switch to acetate consumption and convert acetate back into acetyl-CoA to be fed into the high yield TCA cycle. This results in slower gowth than the glucose phase as carbon uptake rates decrease even as higher ATP yields are seen than in fermentation. \n",

    "# Mathematical Background\n",
    "## dynamic Flux Balance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While intracellular fluxes are steady-state at each moment, the environment changes over time. In diauxic growth, the switching period from glucose to acetate consumption is a dynamic process inherently not in steady state. This breaks one of the assumptions of FBA, so Mahadevan et al. developed the Stochastic Optimization Approach to enable modeling of this approach with dynamic FBA (dFBA). This approach wraps the inner, steady-state FBA optimization in time steps where available nutrient concentrations are updated at each time step according to the growth rate and consumption previously calculated. \n",

    "## 1. The Metabolic Layer (Inner Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each cell, thousands of reactions convert nutrients → biomass.\n",

    "### Stoichiometric Matrix\n",

    "$$S \\cdot v = 0$$\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- $v$ = vector of reaction rates (fluxes)\n",
    "- $S$ = stoichiometric matrix (network structure showing how metabolites connect)\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation enforces **mass conservation**: no metabolite can magically appear or disappear.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "- Each reaction uses part of a limited \"enzyme budget\"\n",
    "- Slow enzymes (low $k_{cat}$) cost more\n",

In ecFBA, the total enzyme pool is limited, so teh model must trade off between different pathways and cannot push growth as high. This lowers the achievable growth rate and total biomass, but is more biologically realistic because real cells have finite protein resources. Because respiratory pathways require substantial protein mass, ecFBA often predicts slower growth than unconstrained FBA—even when oxygen is abundant—because the cell must allocate finite proteome resources among competing pathways."
